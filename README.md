TASK TRACKER (using REACT.js and fake JSON server)

This is a Task manager made using react in which you can do the following operations:
1. Add a task.
2. Delete a task.
3. Set reminder of the task (by checking the check box when setting up the task or by double clicking the task already added).
4. Unset reminder(by double clicking the task added to set or unset reminder or by not checking the check box).




To RUN this project do the following:
1. git clone the project.
2. cd task-tracker(go into the project directory)
3. after that install the npm dependencies required to run the project.(just type "npm install" in the terminal).
4. npm start(now you would see the UI part of the project in localhost:3000 but it won't work, to make it work we need a server too which in this case is a fake json server, so we need to run that server too)
5. npm run server(run this command in the new window of the terminal so that both ui part and server work simultaneously and now it will start working. Now you' be able to add or delete tasks set or unset reminder).




Sequence of commands to RUN the project:
1. git clone addressOfTheProject
2. cd task-tracker
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. npm run server (in new terminal window)
